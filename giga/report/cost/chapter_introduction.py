    \chapter{Introduction}
    The Government of \country{} recognizes the importance of digitalization and connectivity to enabling access to quality education as an essential component for achieving its national development goals. As part of its efforts to promote education and technology, the government has partnered with the Giga initiative to connect all schools to the internet. 

    Giga is a global initiative launched in 2019 by UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) that aims to connect every school to the internet by 2030. The initiative is currently active in more than 50 countries worldwide and is supported by a coalition of public and private partners, including governments, technology companies, and civil society organizations. 

    In \country{}, Giga is working with the government to connect schools across the country to the internet. The initiative's goal is to provide reliable and affordable internet access to all schools, teachers, and students in \country{} enabling them to access educational resources and participate in the digital economy fully. Giga will support \country{} in leveraging existing infrastructure, exploring possible technologies, and supporting the mobilization of financial resources to implement connectivity projects. 

    \subsection*{Giga School Connectivity Cost Tool}

    As a foundational step to achieving school connectivity, estimating realistic and credible costs for school connectivity in \country{} is essential. To achieve this Giga 
    has utilized its  School Connectivity Costing Tool and applied it to the \country{} context. The Costing Tool uses three main layers of data. Firstly, 
    it builds upon the school data gathered though Gigaâ€™s Project Connect school mapping initiative. This data includes school geolocations, 
    as well as information about internet availability and, if applicable, the quality of internet connectivity in these schools. 

    Secondly, data on available national internet connectivity is collated and utilized to identify infrastructure gaps in relation to the identified unconnected schools. 
    Thirdly, the Cost Tool applies country-specific internet connectivity cost data, including both primary capital expenditures (CapEx) and ongoing 
    subscription costs (OpEx) components, to estimate the total cost of connecting the identified unconnected schools.  

    The Cost Tool also allows for different scenarios to be tested such as applying various technology options and combinations. Examples could include, 
    focusing only on fiber and cellular connectivity while excluding satellite technology as a connectivity option. Another example is specifying the 
    preferred maximum distance of schools to fiber (e.g., 2km or 5km or 10km). The scenario analysis provides the government with different options to support decision-making, 
    which is often subject to competing factors such as available budget or acceptable length of time for implementing connectivity solution.  

    The report includes an explanation of the methodology underlying the Giga School Connectivity Costing Tool and outlines the assumptions made and data sources employed 
    to arrive at the cost estimates. Uncertainties and limitations of these cost estimates are also highlighted and supported with recommendations to improve quality and 
    robustness of estimates going forward.

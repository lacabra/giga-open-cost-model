    This report is intended for government officials who have used Gigaâ€™s Cost Model to estimate the costs of a connectivity project (i.e., connecting a certain number of schools) or have conducted a project with Giga using the cost model.

    The purpose of this report is to summarize cost estimates for a school connectivity project and to describe the supporting methodology Giga has employed to arrive at these cost estimates.  This report is intended to provide basic project information to key stakeholders to support preliminary project scoping and financial planning.  Note that actual project costs are a market function and can only be secured through outreach to market participants (e.g., RFI, RFP, etc.).

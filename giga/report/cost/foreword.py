    This report is intended for government officials who have used Giga’s Cost Model Tool for estimating the costs of a connectivity project (i.e., connecting a certain number of schools) or conducted a project with Giga using this tool.   The report serves to provide an overview of the tool, its estimates and limitations, and the potential costs of connecting all schools in the country.  

    The purpose of this report is to summarize cost estimates for a school connectivity project and to describe the supporting methodology that Giga’s Cost Model uses to arrive at such estimates, including the model’s limitations and generalizations.  This report is intended to provide basic project information to key stakeholders to support preliminary project scoping and financial planning.  Note that actual project costs are a market function and can only be secured through outreach (e.g., RFI, RFP, etc.) to market participants.

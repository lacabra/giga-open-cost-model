    The School connectivity cost model developed by Giga provides a robust approach for estimating the costs associated with global school connectivity projects. 
    By leveraging existing data and incorporating various connectivity options, the tool offers valuable insights into possible capital expenditures and operating costs. 
    It considers the specific needs and geographical distribution of schools, optimizing connectivity costs through economies of scale and shared infrastructure.

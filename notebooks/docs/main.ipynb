    "## Cost Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [cost estimation notebook](../cost-scenario.ipynb) provides a modeling interface for estimating the total cost of connecting a group of schools. It estimates the CapEx, OpEx, and NPV connectivity costs by technology under different scenarios. The process is broken down into three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I. Configuration**: where you can configure a variety of model parameters\n",
    "* **II. Run the Model**: where you can start the model execution\n",
    "* **III. Results**: where you can examine the results in tables and plots and download them locally\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the notebook is interactive.\n",
    "Namely, you can update the configurations, run the models again, and generate a new set of outputs.\n",
    "You will need to click `Run Model Again` button and re-run the models again after a re-configuration (by clicking the `Run Model` button), and you will need to explicitly re-generate the outputs (by clicking the various `Generate ...` buttons) to see the ouputs updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to upload a configuration from a local machine, use the `Import Config` button to populate the configuration sets from a local file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have finalized or updated the configuration above, click **Run Model** to generate new results and display summary tables that show aggregated cost statistics across the schools of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final section below show electricity availability and costs. For additional visualizations, download your results (by clicking `Results Package` button) and upload them at a later time in the `Results drilldown` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The following scenarios are available in the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Lowest Cost`: determines the lowest cost of connectivity for the schools in question by selecting across the available and feasible technologies. Note that this is a heuristic approximation of the optimal value unless one technology only is selected.\n",
    "- `Priorities`: computes the total cost of connecting all the unconnected schools by using the selected technologies (if possible) in the following order: `Fiber`, `Cellular`, `P2P`and `Satellite`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters can be configured in the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario**\n",

    "    * `Technologies` you can select or deselect the available technologies (Fiber, Cellular, P2P and Satellite).\n",
    "    * `OpEx Years` determines the number of years that will be considered in the total cost estimates, where total cost is CapEx + OpEx * `OpEx Years`\n",
    "    * `Bandwidth Demand (Mbps)` determines the expected demand at each school being considered\n",
    "    * `Use Budget Constraint` flag that allows users to specif a budget, when set will run a constrained optimization on lowest cost or single technology scenarios\n",
    "    * `Project Budget (Millions USD)` sets the maximum budget for the connectivity project being analyzed, this budget is for the NPV of the project. Under `Lowest Cost` scenario, the tool will try to maximize the number of schools connected within the given budget; under `Priorities` scenario, the tool will connect schools with the ordered technologies until the budget runs out.\n",

    "## Model Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the connectivity models is briefly described below.\n",
    "For more details please see [here](models.ipynb).\n",
    "The cost models are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fiber Model**: asses the costs of connectivity using fiber. Can optionally consider economies of scale, which allows schools that already connected with fiber during modeling to be used as fiber nodes. CapEx considers infrastructure costs of laying fiber, modem/terminal installation costs at school and solar installation if needed. OpEx considers maintenance of fiber infrastructure, maintenance of equipment at school, costs of internet at the school, and electricity costs.\n",
    "* **Cellular Model**: asses the costs of connectivity using cellular. CapEx considers modem installation at school and solar installation if needed. No other infrastructure costs are considered. OpEx considers maintenance of equipment at school, costs of internet at the school, and electricity costs.\n",
    "* **P2P Model**: asses the cost of connectivity using point to point wireless technology. CapEx considers infrastructure costs of installing a transmitter at a cell tower (or school) and a receiver at school, modem/terminal installation costs at school and solar installation if needed. OpEx considers maintenance of equipment at school, costs of internet at the school, and electricity costs.\n",
    "* **Satellite Model**: asses the cost of connectivity using LEO satellite. CapEx considers terminal installation at school and solar installation if needed. OpEx considers maintenance of equipment at school, costs of internet at the school, and electricity costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modeling capabilities are defined within `giga/models`. The models are further broken down into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nodes: atomic, modular building blocks that contain a computation, transformation, or external data\n",
    "* Components: stacks nodes together with a clear and specific purpose (e.g. use case driven - compute cost of fiber connection) prepares the models to join into the entities that solve a specific problem\n",
    "* Scenarios: drives the computation by piecing together multiple components and solving a specific problem by deriving a key result. Allows same components to serve multiple purposes: e.g. answer the questions of what is the cost of connecting all schools in Rwanda to the internet? VS If there is a budget of $10M which schools should be connected to maximize the number of students with internet access?\n"

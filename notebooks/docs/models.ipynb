    "# Model Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to [main](main.ipynb) docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key model components are outlined below.\n",
    "Their architecture is presented in diagram format and code snippet examples are shown as well.\n",
    "As a reminder a model component is differentiated from a model node in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nodes: atomic, modular building blocks that contain a computation, transformation, or serve external data\n",
    "* Components: stacks nodes together with a clear and specific purpose (e.g. use case driven - compute cost of fiber connection) prepares the models to join into the entities that solve a specific problem\n",
    "* Scenarios: drives the computation by piecing together multiple components and solving a specific problem by deriving a key result. Allows same components to serve multiple purposes: e.g. answer the questions of what is the cost of connecting all schools in Rwanda to the internet? VS If there is a budget of $10M which schools should be connected to maximize the number of students with internet access?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The models compute the total cost of connecting a school to the internet.\n",
    "However, those costs have two types of attribution:\n",
    "1. The service provider: or the entity responsible for serving the internet connectivity\n",
    "2. The school: or the consumer of the internet connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the cost strucutres for these two entities of providing new connectivity are quite different.\n",
    "In these models the general breakdown of cost attribution is as follows for each technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Technology   | Cost Category                | Provider | School |\n",
    "| ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------ |\n",
    "| Fiber        | Laying Fiber Cable           |     ☑️    |        |\n",
    "| Fiber        | Maintaining Fiber Cable      |     ☑️    |        |\n",
    "| Fiber        | Cost per Mbps                |          |    ☑️   |\n",

    "| Electricity  | Solar Total Cost (USD/Watt)  |          |    ☑️   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some of the technologies do not have an explicit provider cost associated with them, this is because it is assumed that the provider is able to deliver internet connectivity for that technology without additional investment (e.g. the technology is already ready avaible in the region of interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fiber Cost Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation of the fiber cost model can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description**: estimates the CapEx and annual OpEx costs of connecting a school to the internet using fiber.\n",
    "Considers economies of scale by default which assumes schools that have been connected to a fiber network can be used as fiber nodes for unconnected schools.  \n",
    "* **Sub-models**:\n",
    "\t* Distance model: computes distances between point pairs (default is Haversine distance)\n",
    "\t* Connection model: connects a set of unconnected components (e.g. schools) to connected components (e.g. fiber nodes). Default is a greedy connect model that connects closest unconnected components to one that is connected. The default configuration assumes that unconnected components can can also be used as connections after they've been connected. This enables the economies of scale heuristic.\n",
    "* **Parameters**: the parameters exposed to users can be found below:\n",
    "\t* `Annual cost per Mbps (USD)`: the annual cost of connectivity per Mbps in US Dollars\n",
    "    * `Cost Per km (USD)` is the average cost of laying fiber lines per km in US Dollars\n",
    "    * `Maintenance Cost per km (USD)` is the expected annual maintenace cost of new fiber lines in US Dollars\n",
    "    * `Maximum Connection Length (km)` is the maximum length of an individual fiber connection, if a single fiber connection exceeds this length, it will not be considered feasible\n",
    "    * `Annual Power Required (kWh)` is the annual power in kWh needed to operate the equipment\n",
    "    * `Economies of Scale` indicates if an economies of scale approach should be used when estimating the needed length of fiber lines\n",
    "    * `Schools as fiber nodes` indicates whether schools that are already connected with fiber can act as fiber nodes\n",
    "    * `Correction Coeficient` is a multiplier for the distance calculated with Line Of Sight between schools and schools and fiber nodes.\n",
    "* **Data Inputs**: the typically external data needed to drive the models are outlined below. Please note that data inputs are accessible to model components through the `DataSpace` client.\n",
    "\t* Fiber node locations, as lat/lon coordinates OR distance (of the school) to the nearest fiber node\n",
    "\t* School entities, which includes coordinates and other properties)\n",
    "* **Outputs**: the fiber generates a collection of connection costs for each school considered. The connection costs contain both CapEx and OpEx estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The fiber model consists of the following sub-models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distance model node for computing distances between two points. A custom implementation can be used instead of the default Haversine distance model.\n",
    "* Connector model node used to identify feasible connections between points. A greedy distance connector model is the default. It connects unconnected components (e.g. schools) to connected components (e.g. fiber nodes) by picking the closest components first, where closest is determined by the distance model node.\n",
    "* Electricity model component for estimating the electricity costs associated with installing and operating the internet technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of the fiber model component architecture is shown in the diagram below.\n",
    "The green shaded boxes indicate models for which a custom node could be implemented with a different capability.\n",
    "For example, the default distance metric used in estimating fiber costs is Haversine, if a distance metric along known roads was desired, a new node implementation that calculates that distance between two points can be substituted to derive a different set of results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth model \"driver\" that provides an in-depth overview of how the fiber model works, see the notebook [here](../drivers/fiber-model.ipynb).\n",
    "The example below shows how a custom distance model can be used in a fiber model component.\n",
    "Please note that the custom model below `RoadLengthDistance` is not currently part of the library and is simply an example.\n",

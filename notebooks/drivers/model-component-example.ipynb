    "# Model Component Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines how to implement an example model component that can be used in estimating connectivity costs.\n",
    "We'll work through functional examples of how you can think of components, but let's first define what a model component is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Model Component**: an implementation of a class in the modeling library that performs a cost calculation with the following properties:\n",
    "* It is independently configurable (e.g. has an explicit set of configurable cost driver parameter that dictate its output)\n",
    "* Exposes a `run` method that runs the model, into which the data client is passed (the data client is of type `ModelDataSpace`). This means all the avaible data (schools, fiber data, and cellular data) are availble to the model when it runs\n",
    "* Returns the results inside of an object called `CostResultSpace` which contains the costs attributed to all the schools that the data space has access to\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing model components are implemented as standalone classes in `giga.models.components`.\n",
    "In order to integrate these components into the application, you will need to perform two additional steps in addition to implementing the components:\n",
    "1. Integrate the component into a runnable scenario (see `giga.models.scenarios.priority_scenario` for an example)\n",
    "2. Create a UI component that can manage parameter inputs for this component (see `giga.viz.notebooks.parameters.groups.fiber_technology_parameter_manager.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these are complete you can use the component in the application."

    "## Creating a Sample Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a sample model component that will calculate a hypothetical cost using some simple rules.\n",
    "As an example we'll implement a computation that exercises various cost estimation properties:\n",
    "* Constant capex dictated by `cost_parameter_a`\n",
    "* Variable opex dictated by `cost_parameter_b` for connected schools and `cost_parameter_c` for unconnected schools\n",
    "\n",
